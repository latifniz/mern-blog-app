# Through My Eyes - MERN Blog WebApp

"Through My Eyes" is a MERN stack blog app where React with TypeScript is used for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Admins can create blogs, while users can read, like, and comment on them, creating an interactive and engaging platform for sharing and discussing content.

- Website Link :- https://through-my-eyes.vercel.app/

- Admin Account :- you have to create an account and manually change "isAdmin = true" in your database.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TypeScript, Redux, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node, Express

**Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose

## Optimizations

- In this project i am using React with TypeScript, React Form Hook and React Query(TanStack Query).

- Now days in React, React Hook Form simplifies form handling and validation , reducing boilerplate code.

- React Query streamlines data fetching and caching, optimizing network requests. Together, they enhance development efficiency and improve application performance, providing a seamless user experience in React applications.
